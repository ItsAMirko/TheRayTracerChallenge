# The Ray Tracer Challenge

This project is based on the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://www.amazon.de/Ray-Tracer-Challenge-Test-Driven-Renderer/dp/1680502719)
by [Jamis Buck](https://twitter.com/jamis) and will hopefully contain my own 3D renderer at some point.

I think I'm going to tag the states after each chapter, so anyone who is interested can see the progress from chapter to chapter.
